# Macromania HTML

Macros for [Macromania](https://github.com/worm-blossom/macromania) to generate
[html](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML).

Offers the `<H>` macro for dynamically generated tags, and statically typed macros (`<A>`, `<Abbr>`, etc...).

The statically typed API is based off the [living standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/). Does not yet have macros for *all* tags.
