          Willow is a system for giving meaningful, hierarchical names to
          arbitrary sequences of bytes (called{" "}
          <Em>payloads</Em>), not unlike a filesystem. For example, you might
          give the name <Path components={["blog", "idea", "1"]} />{" "}
          to the bytestring <Code>Dear reader, I've got a great idea</Code>.
        </P>

        <P>
          You also give the name <Path components={["blog", "idea", "2"]} />
          {" "}
          to the bytestring <Code>(watch this space)</Code>.

          Things would be rather chaotic if everyone wrote to the same blog.

          — intuitively, each user writes to their own, separate universe of
          data. Willow allows for various ways of controlling who gets to write

          sophisticated capability systems.

        <P>
          Willow further allows the aggregation of subspaces into completely
          independent{" "}
          <Em>namespaces</Em>. Data from a public wiki should live in a separate
          namespace than data from a photo-sharing application for my family.
          Some namespaces should allow anyone to set up subspaces within them,
          others might require authorisation from a trusted manager. Willow
          offers a flexible mechanism for using different policies on a
          per-namespace basis.

          This constitutes a full overview of the data model of Willow.
          Applications read and write payloads from and to subspaces, addressing
          via hierarchical paths. Willow tracks timestamps of write operations,
          newer writes replace older writes in the manner of a traditional file
          system. These data collections live in namespaces; read and write
          access to both namespaces and subspaces can be controlled through a
          variety of policies.

            Some questions in protocol design have no clear-cut answer. Should
            namespaces be identified via human-readable strings, or via the
            public keys of some digital signature scheme? That depends entirely

                When two peers connect and wish to update each other, they

            The Willow data model stays fairly compact by deliberately
            sidestepping some rather important questions. In this section, we
            point to our answers for the most important ones.
          </P>

          <P>
            How can we precisely delimit meaningful groups of{" "}
            <Rs n="Entry" />, for example, all recipes that Alfie posted on
            their blog in the past three months? Grouping <Rs n="Entry" />{" "}
            always incurs a tradeoff between <Em>expressivity</Em>{" "}
            (which sets of <Rs n="Entry" /> can be characterised) and{" "}
            <Em>efficiency</Em> (how quickly a database can retrieve all its
            {" "}
            <Rs n="Entry" />{" "}
            of an arbitrary grouping). We present a carefully crafted selection
            of ways of grouping <Rs n="Entry" />{" "}
            <R n="grouping_entries">here</R>.
          </P>

          <P>
            How should we encode the concepts of Willow for storage or network
            transmission? Due to the parameterised nature of Willow, there can
            be no overarching answer, but we cover some recurring aspects of the
            question <R n="encodings">here</R>.
          </P>

          <P>
            How should we select the <R n="AuthorisationToken" /> and{" "}
            <R n="is_authorised_write" />{" "}
            parameters? Different deployments of Willow will have different
            needs. We provide{" "}
            <R n="meadowcap">Meadowcap</R>, a capability-based solution that
            should be suitable for most use-cases.
          </P>

          <P>
            How do we efficiently and securely compute <Rs n="store_join" />
            {" "}
            over a network to synchronise data between peers? Again, different
            settings require different answers, but we provide the{" "}
            <R n="sync">Willow General Purpose Sync</R>{" "}
            protocol as a well-engineered, privacy-preserving solution that
            should be applicable to a wide range of scenarios.
          </P>

          <P>
            How can we encrypt <Rs n="Entry" />{" "}
            while retaining the semantics of the original, unencrypted data?
            This question lies at the heart of end-to-end encryption for Willow,
            and we discuss our findings <R n="e2e">here</R>.
          </P>

          <P>
            How can a database provide efficient access to{" "}
            <Rs n="Entry" />? We give an introduction to the types of queries
            that a data store for Willow should support, and present some data
            structures for supporting them efficiently{" "}
            <R n="d3storage">here</R>.
          </P>

          <P>
            How can I contribute to Willow and support it? So glad you asked —
            we have prepared a collection of pointers{" "}
            <R n="projects_and_communities">here</R>.
