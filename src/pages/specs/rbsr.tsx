          When two peers wish to synchronise data, they typically first exchange
          which <Rs n="Area" /> in which <Rs n="namespace" />{" "}
          they are interested in. Intersecting these <Rs n="Area" />{" "}
          yields the sets of <Rs n="AuthorisedEntry" />{" "}
          for which they then need to bring each other up to speed. In this
          document, we present a strategy for doing so efficiently.
        </P>

        <P>
          Given the <Rs n="AuthorisedEntry" />{" "}
          that the peers have available, there can be two cases that necessitate
          data exchange. First, one peer might have an <R n="AuthorisedEntry" />
          {" "}
          that the other does not have, and second, the peers might hold
          nonequal parts of the <R n="Payload" /> of some common{" "}
          <R n="AuthorisedEntry" />.
        </P>

        <P>
          As a first step to solving the problem, we simplify it. If{" "}
          <Rs n="AuthorisedEntry" />{" "}
          contained information about locally available <R n="Payload" />{" "}
          bytes, then both cases would merge into a single case: one peer might
          have a datum that the other lacks. Hence, we do not synchronise{" "}
          <Rs n="AuthorisedEntry" /> directly, but <Rs n="LengthyAuthorisedEntry" />:

            The task of the two peers then becomes conceptually simple: they
            each have a set of{" "}
            <Rs n="LengthyAuthorisedEntry" />, and they need to inform each other about
            all <Rs n="LengthyAuthorisedEntry" />{" "}
            the other party does not have, that is, they each need to compute
            the union of their two sets. In the scientific literature, this
            problem is known as{" "}
            <Def n="set_reconciliation" r="set reconciliation" />
            <Bib item="minsky2003set" />.
          </P>
        </PreviewScope>

        <P>
          Once the two peers have reconciled their sets, they can filter out
          {" "}
          <Rs n="AuthorisedEntry" />{" "}
          that overwrite each other, and they can separately request any missing
          (suffixes of){" "}
          <Rs n="Payload" />. Going forward, we thus concentrate on the set
          reconciliation part only.

        <PreviewScope>
          <P>
            To perform set reconciliation, we adapt the approach of{" "}

          Range-based set reconciliation solves the problem recursively. To
          reconcile two sets, one peer first computes a hash over all items in
          its set, and sends this fingerprint to the other peer. That peer then
          computes the fingerprint over its items as well. If the fingerprints
          match, they are done reconciling.

        <P>
          If the fingerprints do not match, there are two options. First, the
          peer can split its set in half and then initiate set reconciliation
          for each half concurrently (by transmitting its hashes for both
          halves). Second, if the set is sufficiently small, the peer can
          instead simply transmit its items in the set. The other peer responds
          to this with all other items that it held in the set, completing the
          process of reconciliation.

          Overall, the peers collaboratively drill down to the differences
          between their two sets in a logarithmic number of communication
          rounds, spending only little bandwidth on those regions of the
          original sets where they hold the same items. Note that peers can
          actually split sets into arbitrarily many subsets in each step.
          Splitting into more subsets per step decreases the total number of
          communication rounds.

        <P>
          To any such <R n="D3RangeEntrySet" />, a peer replies with its own

        <P>
          When a peer receives a <R n="D3RangeFingerprint" /> that matches the
          {" "}
          <R n="d3rbsr_fp" /> over its local <Rs n="LengthyAuthorisedEntry" /> in the same
          {" "}
          <R n="D3Range" />, the peer should reply with an empty{" "}
          <R n="D3RangeEntrySet" /> for that <R n="D3Range" />, setting the{" "}
          <R n="D3RangeEntrySetWantResponse" /> flag to{" "}
          <Code>false</Code>. This notifies the sender of the{" "}

          that reconciliation has successfully concluded for the{" "}

        </P>

        <Hr />

        <P>
          The peers might be interested in when they have successfully completed
          reconciliation of a particular{" "}
          <R n="D3Range" />. Unfortunately, tracking all the <Rs n="D3Range" />
          {" "}
          that you receive and determining whether their union covers the
          particular <R n="D3Range" />{" "}
          you are interested in is a comparatively expensive (and annoying)
          algorithmic problem. To circumvent this problem, peers can attach
          small bits of metadata to their messages: whenever a peer splits a
          {" "}
          <R n="D3Range" /> into a set of covering{" "}
          <Rs n="D3Range" />, the peer can simply attach some metadata to the
          final such subrange that it sends that indicates which of the{" "}
          <Rs n="D3Range" />{" "}
          sent by the other peer has now been fully covered by subranges.
        </P>

        <P>
          As long as both peers are accurate in supplying this metadata, they
          can maintain perfect information about the progress of reconciliation
          without the need for any sophisticated data structures. Peers should
          be cautious that a malicious peer could provide wildly inadequate
          metadata, but in general this is tolerable: a malicious peer can
          sabotage reconciliation in all sorts of interesting ways regardless.
        </P>
