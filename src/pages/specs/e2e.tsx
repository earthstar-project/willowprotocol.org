          Willow has no built-in mechanisms for encrypting data. Still, it would
          be nice if peers (say, an always-on server in the cloud) could
          facilitate data exchange without being privy to the data they share.
          While it is straightforward to encrypt payloads, that still leaves the
          relays to learn about{" "}
          <Rs n="Entry" />, that is, all the metadata. In this document, we
          examine how we can protect this metadata.
        </P>

        <P>
          Unfortunately, we cannot simply encrypt all the fields of{" "}
          <Rs n="Entry" />, because peers need to access this data to determine
          which <Rs n="Entry" />{" "}
          overwrite which others. More precisely, peers need the ability to
          compute <Rs n="store_join" /> of{" "}
          <Rs n="store" />. These well-defined concepts give us precise limits
          on which properties of which metadata we have to preserve, and which
          properties we can vigorously scramble.
        </P>

        <P>
          Typically, you would use symmetric encryption to achieve
          confidentiality â€” the core data model can provide authenticity via
          {" "}
          <Rs n="AuthorisationToken" />{" "}
          already. As for the granularity at which to use different keys, we
          consider three relevant options: a key per{" "}
          <R n="namespace" />, a key per{" "}
          <R n="subspace" />, or a key per combination of <R n="subspace" /> and

          <P>
            When a peer stores a{" "}
            <R n="Payload" />, it automatically knows its length and it can

          <P>
            On the bright side, the <R n="Payload" />{" "}

            Anyone who can decrypt this <R n="Payload" />{" "}

            {" "}

            is supposed to be indistinguishable from random data, but preserving
            relative ordering is very much non-random. Hence, we begrudingly
            accept that Willow deals in plaintext <Rs n="Timestamp" /> only.

          <P>
            The privacy-conscious user might still choose to obscure their{" "}

            to downgrade the resolution to individual days, in order to obscure
