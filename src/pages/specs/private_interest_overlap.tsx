          This document details a mechanism for implementing capability-enforced
          read-access-control when synchronising data between two Willow peers.
          This is more complex than simply defining a type of read access
          capabilities and then exchanging those in the open, because such a
          process would leak information such as <Rs n="NamespaceId" />,{" "}
          <Rs n="SubspaceId" />, and <Rs n="Path" />{" "}
          to peers without read-access. We describe a more sophisticated
          technique that does not leak such information, even in realistic
          adversarial settings.

            We want to allow peers to specify pairs of <Rs n="namespace" /> and

            <Rs n="AreaOfInterest" />, and then synchronise the{" "}
            <Rs n="aoi_intersection" />. Furthermore, a peer should only be
            given access to information for which it can prove that the original
            author allows them to access it. To this end, we start by defining
            the notion of a <R n="read_capability" />.

              Access control can then be implemented by answering only requests

          <P>
            The simplemost solution consists in the peers openly exchanging{" "}
            <Rs n="read_capability" /> and then specifying their{" "}
            <Rs n="AreaOfInterest" />, which must be fully{" "}
            <R n="area_include_area">included</R> in the <Rs n="granted_area" />
            {" "}
            of the{" "}
            <Rs n="read_capability" />. This works well for managing read access
            control and determining which <Rs n="Entry" />{" "}
            to synchronise, but it leaks some potentially sensitive information.
            Two examples:
          </P>

          <P>
            First, suppose that Alfie creates an <R n="Entry" /> at{" "}
            <R n="Path" /> <Path components={["gemma_stinks"]} />, and gives a
            {" "}
            <R n="read_capability" /> for this <R n="Path" />{" "}
            to Betty. Later, Betty connects to Gemma's machine for syncing, and
            asks for <Path components={["gemma_stinks"]} /> in Alfieâ€™s{" "}
            <R n="subspace" />. In sending her{" "}
            <R n="read_capability" />, she hands a signed proof to Gemma that
            Alfie{" "}
            <Sidenotes
              notes={[
                "Gemma does not, in fact, stink.",
                <>
                  Also, Alfie is really very nice and would never say such a
                  thing outside of thought experiments for demonstrating the
                  dangers of leaking <Rs n="Path" />.
                </>,
              ]}
            >
              thinks
            </Sidenotes>{" "}
            she stinks. Not good.
          </P>

          <P>
            Second, suppose a scenario where everyone{" "}
            <R n="e2e_paths">uses encrypted paths</R>, with individual
            encryption keys per{" "}
            <R n="subspace" />. Alfie synchronises with Betty, asking her for
            random-looking <Rs n="Path" />{" "}
            of the same structure in ten different{" "}
            <Rs n="subspace" />. Betty has the decryption keys for all but one
            of the{" "}
            <Rs n="subspace" />. All the paths she can decrypt happen to decrypt
            to{" "}
            <Path components={["gemma_stinks"]} />. This gives Betty a strong
            idea about what the tenth person thinks of Gemma, despite the fact
            that Betty cannot decrypt the <R n="Path" />. Not good.
          </P>

          <P>
            Ideally, we would like to employ a mechanism where peers cannot
            learn any information beyond the <Rs n="granted_area" /> of the{" "}
            <Rs n="read_capability" />{" "}
            which they hold at the start of the process. Unfortunately, such a
            mechanism would have to involve privacy-preserving verification of
            cryptographic signatures, and any suitable primitives are
            exceedingly complicated.
          </P>

          <P>
            Instead, we design solutions which do not allow peers to learn about
            the existence of any <R n="NamespaceId" />, <R n="SubspaceId" />, or
            {" "}
            <R n="Path" />{" "}
            which they did not know about already. If, for example, both peers
            knew about a certain{" "}
            <R n="namespace" />, they should both get to know that the other
            peer also knows about that <R n="namespace" />. But for a{" "}
            <R n="namespace" />{" "}
            which only one of the peers knows about, the other peer should not
            learn its <R n="NamespaceId" />.
          </P>

          <P>
            Such solutions cannot prevent peers from confirming guesses about
            data they shouldn't know about. Hence, it is important that{" "}
            <Rs n="NamespaceId" /> and <Rs n="SubspaceId" />{" "}
            are sufficiently long and random-looking. Similarly, encrypting{" "}
            <Rs n="Component" /> with different encryption keys for different
            {" "}
            <Rs n="subspace" /> can ensure that <Rs n="Path" />{" "}
            are unguessable. Because valid <Rs n="Timestamp" />
            <Marginale>
              Finding efficient encryption schemes and privacy-preserving
              synchronisation techniques that work for <Rs n="Timestamp" />{" "}
              is an interesting research endeavour, but out of scope for us.
            </Marginale>{" "}
            can easily be guessed, we do not try to hide information about them.
          </P>

          <P>
            In addition to withholding information from unauthorised peers, we
            also wish to defend against{" "}
            <AE href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">
              active eavesdroppers
            </AE>. An active eavesdropper is an attacker who can read and modify
            all transmissions by the two peers. There exist{" "}

              well-known protections
            </AE>{" "}
            for settings where the two peers have prior knowledge about each
            other before they start the connection, but we also want to allow
            for sync between anonymous peers who do not know each other at all.
            Hence, even after the other peer has proven to us that they have
            access to some data, we still must be careful about what we send (or
            rather, how we encrypt it).

            <Li>
              communication sessions are encrypted such that they can only be

            The first bullet point should be straightforward: no requested data
            is explicitly handed over, unless the sync partner demonstrates that
            it was granted read access.
          </P>

          <P>
            The second bullet point serves to defend against{" "}
            <AE href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">
              active eavesdroppers
            </AE>. At the start of the sync session, the two peers perform a
            handshake in which they negotiate how to encrypt their
            communication. A typical choice would be a{" "}
            <AE href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange">
              Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange
            </AE>, which results in a shared secret, which can be used as the
            shared key for symmetric encryption of the communication session.
            Crucially, as part of the handshake, the peers prove to each other
            knowledge of the secret key corresponding to some public key they
            transmit. We require those to be <Rs n="dss_pk" /> and{" "}

                  practice when capabilities can be delegated. Peers can even
                  create ephemeral keypairs per sync session and create valid
                  capabilities by delegation which they discard after the
                  session.

          <P>
            An active eavesdropper faces a dilemma: if they do not manipulate
            the handshake, they cannot derive the decryption secret and cannot
            listen in on the sync session. If they do manipulate the handshake
            by replacing the exchanged <Rs n="dss_pk" />{" "}
            with ones for which they have the{" "}
            <R n="correspond">corresponding</R>{" "}

            <Rs n="read_capability" /> for those{" "}
            <Rs n="dss_pk" />. Since a good capability system makes forgery
            impossible, they will not be able to do so. The peers, then, will
            not transmit any sensitive data.

                private set intersection (PSI)
              </AE>{" "}
              might be irritated at this point. The literature is full of papers
              that point out the exchange of (salted) hashes as a rookie
              mistake. A fairly representative example{" "}

            <Blockquote>
              This simple solution is unfortunately{" "}
              <Em>insecure</Em>. The reason is that given Aliceâ€™s hashed values
              Bob can test whether an element <M>x</M>{" "}
              appears in her set by searching for <M>H(x)</M>{" "}
              in Aliceâ€™s hashed set. In particular, when Aliceâ€™s set comes from
              a polynomial domain, Bob can recover her entire input set.
            </Blockquote>

            <P>
              A peer can check for membership of a value which it itself has not
              submitted to the PSI session, which goes against the typical
              definition of PSI.
            </P>

            <P>
              We argue that this strong notion of PSI misses the point in our
              setting: if a malicious peer wants to learn about any value, then
              it can simply submit it as part of its input set, whether the
              value actually fits semantically into its set or not (in our case,
              whether the peer is actually interested in the data or not). Since
              academia mostly works by appeals to authority, here is a
              widely-cited paper that presents the same argument{" "}
              <Bib item="de2010linear"></Bib>:
            </P>

            <Blockquote>
              Malicious parties cannot be prevented from modifying their input
              sets, even if a protocol is proven secure in the malicious model.
              [...] We claim that this issue cannot be effectively addressed
              without some mechanism to authorize client inputs. Consequently, a
              trusted certification authority (CA) is needed to certify input
              sets, [...].
            </Blockquote>

            <P>
              Any notion of a trusted certification authority of the inputs that
              peers bring to their sync sessions goes widely beyond the
              scenarios in which we want to enable secure syncing. Hence, we can
              reject the overly strict definition of PSI in the academic
              literature, and solve our problem via the simple technique of
              exchanging salted hashes.

              Naively transmitting <Rs n="read_capability" />{" "}
              would allow an active eavesdropper to learn the information in the
              capabilities. Hence, the transmission of the capabilities must
              omit all sensitive information. This is possible because the two
              peers a have a shared context â€” the{" "}

              Note that peers need to store a potentially unbounded number of
              hash-boolean pairs that they receive, but they do not have an

              <Rs n="resource_handle" />{" "}
              to deal with this problem. When resource limits are communicated
              and enforced, how should peers select which{" "}

            </P>

            <P>
              Imagine two peers, with the exact same 400{" "}
              <Rs n="PrivateInterest" />, but they can each submit only 20 into
              the private overlap detection process due to resource limits. If
              they each selected 20 of their interests at random, they would
              likely part ways thinking they don't share any common interests.
              If they both sorted their <Rs n="PrivateInterest" />{" "}
              (say, lexicographically according to some agreed-upon encoding)
              and transmitted the first 20 ones, then observers might be able to

            <P>
              As a solution, both peers should send the{" "}

              way, the sorting order is an independent, random permutation in

              <Rs n="PrivateInterest" /> are likely to detect that overlap.

            Throughout the following, Alfie and Betty are honest peers, Muriarty
            is a malicious peer who may deviate arbitrarily from the WGPS, and
            Epson is an active eavesdropper on the networking layer who can
            read, modify, drop, or insert arbitrary bytes on a WGPS
            communication channel.

            <Ul>
              <Li>
                Alfie and Muriarty sync, and Muriarty tries to glean as much
                information from/about Alfie as possible.
              </Li>
              <Li>
                Alfie and Betty sync without knowing any long-term secrets of
                each other, and Epson attacks the session and tries to glean as
                much information from/about Alfie and Betty.
              </Li>
            </Ul>

            <P>
              Note that Epson can simulate a Muriarty, or they could even be the
              same person. Epson is only interesting for cases where Alfie syncs
              with somebody who has more knowledge than Epson, so we do not
              consider the cases where Muriarty and Epson collaborate.
            </P>

            <P>
              If Alfie and Betty know longterm public keys, they can exclude an
              active attacker during the handshake. If only one of them knows a
              longterm secret of the other, Epson is less powerful than in the
              setting where neither knows a longterm secret of the other; hence
              we only analyze the prior scenario.
